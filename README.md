📄 Abstract
Access to quality healthcare remains a significant challenge in rural areas due to geographic isolation and insufficient medical infrastructure. This project proposes a Smart Healthcare System aimed at connecting rural populations with qualified healthcare professionals through technology-driven solutions.

Key features include telemedicine support via video calls, AI-powered symptom analysis, and secure digital health records. A user-friendly mobile app and web portal allow users to track symptoms, manage medications, schedule appointments, and receive health tips in local languages. By integrating smart technologies with community outreach, the project ensures timely, equitable, and efficient healthcare delivery, empowering communities and fostering a healthier tomorrow.

✨ Key Features
Real-Time Video Consultations: Secure, high-quality video calls between patients and doctors using WebRTC.

Appointment Management: Easily schedule, reschedule, and cancel appointments with preferred doctors.

Comprehensive Patient Dashboards: Patients can view medical history, track prescriptions, and update their health information.

Efficient Doctor Dashboards: Doctors can manage patient records, view upcoming appointments, and submit reports seamlessly.

Digital Health Records: A centralized and secure system for storing lab results, prescriptions, diagnosis history, and doctor's notes.

Live Health Monitoring: Integration with IoT sensors to track vital signs like temperature, heart rate, and oxygen levels for immediate alerts.

Personalized Health Plans: Intelligent algorithms generate personalized healthcare plans based on medical history, lifestyle, and predictive analysis.

Cross-Platform Accessibility: A fully responsive design ensures a seamless experience on mobile apps, web portals, and tablets.
